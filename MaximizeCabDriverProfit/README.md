# Maximize Cab Driver Profit 

The Maximize Cab Driver Profit notebook demonstrates how to train a `Reinforcement Learning (RL)` agent to maximize its profit in a simulated urban environment, where the agent develops an optimal strategy for picking up and dropping off passengers while minimizing idle time and fuel costs.

## Project Structure
The project follows the folllowing steps:
- Setting up the Environment by defining Geographic Zones, Time of Day, Reward Structure and an agent class.
- Training the agent through a large number of simulated episodes each representing a full day.
- Testing the agent by simulating 1 episode.
