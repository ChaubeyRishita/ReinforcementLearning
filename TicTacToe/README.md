# TicTacToe

The TicTacToe notebook demonstrates how to train a `Reinforcement Learning (RL)` agent to play and master the game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Project Structure
The project follows the folllowing steps:
- Setting up the Game Environment by defining functions `display_board`, `check_win`, `get_possible_moves`, `is_game_over` and an agent class.
- Training the agent by playing a large number of games against itself.
- Testing the agent by playing a game against it.
